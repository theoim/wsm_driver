# How to Test HTTP Server Example

## Step 1: Prepare software

The following serial terminal program and web browser are required for the HTTP Server example test, download and install from below links.

- [Tera Term][link-tera_term]
- A web browser (e.g. Chrome, Edge, or Firefox)

## Step 2: Prepare hardware

1. Connect the WIZnet Ethernet chip (W5500 or W6300) to the ESP32-S3 board over SPI, following the pin table in [Step 3](#step-3-setup-http-server-example).
2. Connect an Ethernet cable from the module's RJ45 port to your PC or network.
3. Connect the ESP32-S3 board to your PC with a USB cable.

## Step 3: Setup HTTP Server Example

### Chip and SPI configuration

Set the target and open menuconfig:

```bash
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py menuconfig
```

Select **Component config**.
![][link-config_main]

Select **WIZnet WSM Driver** under Component config.
![][link-config_component]

Choose the WIZnet chip, and check the per-socket buffer size. SPI host, clock, and pins follow the selected chip automatically. In this example, SPI2 of the ESP32-S3 is used at 33 MHz.
![][link-config_wiz_toe]

> This example ships with **W6300** selected by default (`sdkconfig.defaults`). Switch to W5500 under `Component config -> WIZnet WSM Driver -> WIZnet chip` if needed.

**W5500 wiring (standard SPI)**

| W5500 | ESP32-S3 Pin |
|-------|--------------|
| MISO  | 13 |
| MOSI  | 11 |
| SCLK  | 12 |
| CS    | 10 |
| RESET | 9  |
| INT   | 14 |

**W6300 wiring (QSPI)**

| W6300   | ESP32-S3 Pin |
|---------|--------------|
| D0 (MOSI) | 11 |
| D1 (MISO) | 13 |
| D2 (IO2)  | 14 *(Quad mode only)* |
| D3 (IO3)  | 9  *(Quad mode only)* |
| SCLK    | 12 |
| CS      | 10 |
| RESET   | 21 |
| INT     | 8  |

### Network backend

`Component config -> WIZnet WSM Driver -> Network backend` picks which stack carries the traffic. **The example source does not change** — the choice is made by the linker:

| menuconfig choice | What `src/http_server.c`'s `ops->socket()` / `ops->recv()` / `ops->send()` resolve to |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **TOE (hardware TCP/IP)** *(default)* | `__wrap_lwip_*` — `-Wl,--wrap` redirects lwIP's BSD entry points to the WIZnet chip's hardware sockets (`port/ioLibrary_Driver/src/wiztoe_wrap.c`) |
| **esp_eth MACRAW + software LwIP** | `lwip_*` — the chip runs as a plain SPI Ethernet MAC and the ESP32-S3's software LwIP owns TCP/IP |

The engine never contains an `#if`: it is handed the component's `net_eth_ops` vtable (plain `lwip_*`, which the linker aims at whichever backend is selected), and Wi-Fi is handed `net_wifi_ops`, which binds `__real_lwip_*` when the wrap is active so Wi-Fi always reaches the real software LwIP.

The ioLibrary `httpServer` (`Internet/httpServer`) is **not** used. It drives the chip's socket registers directly, so `--wrap` has nothing to intercept and one source could not serve both backends — `src/http_server.c` speaks HTTP/1.1 over `ops->recv()` / `ops->send()` instead.

### Network configuration

Network identity and ports live in `examples/http/inc/net_config.h`, the same way as in `examples/loopback` and `examples/dhcp_dns`:

```cpp
#define NET_MAC_ADDR          {0x00, 0x08, 0xDC, 0x12, 0x34, 0x56}
#define NET_IP_ADDR           {192, 168, 11, 2}
#define NET_SUBNET_MASK       {255, 255, 255, 0}
#define NET_GATEWAY           {192, 168, 11, 1}
#define NET_DNS_ADDR          {8, 8, 8, 8}

#define WIFI_SSID             "your-ssid"      /* leave empty -> Ethernet only */
#define WIFI_PASS             "your-password"

#define HTTP_PORT             80      /* Ethernet */
#define WIFI_HTTP_PORT        8080    /* Wi-Fi    */
#define HTTP_RECV_TIMEOUT_MS  (10 * 1000)
#define HTTP_BUF_SIZE         2048
```

`main.c` assembles a `wiz_NetInfo` from these and hands it to `wiznet_net_init()`, which applies it to the chip with `wizchip_setnetinfo()`.

### Web page

The page served to the browser is defined in `examples/http/inc/web_page.h` and answered for `/` and `/index.html`.

```cpp
#define index_page  "<!DOCTYPE html>"\
                    "<html lang=\"en\">"\
                    "<head>"\
                        "<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">"\
                        "<title>HTTP Server Example</title>"\
                    "</head>"\
                    "<body>"\
                        "<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"\
                    "</body>"\
                    "</html>"
```

### Running on Wi-Fi at the same time (optional)

`net_config.h` ships with the `WIFI_SSID` / `WIFI_PASS` placeholders. Replace them with your AP credentials and the same HTTP server also comes up on a Wi-Fi STA, as a sibling task at the same level as the Ethernet one:

```cpp
http_server_start("eth",  &net_eth_ops,  HTTP_PORT,      wiznet_net_is_up);
http_server_start("wifi", &net_wifi_ops, WIFI_HTTP_PORT, wifi_net_is_up);
```

Each interface gets its own task and its own buffer, so nothing is shared. The two use different ports because with the esp_eth backend they share one LwIP stack, where identical ports would clash on bind.

Clear `WIFI_SSID` to `""` when committing; an empty SSID skips Wi-Fi entirely so the example still builds and runs Ethernet-only for everyone else.

### Architecture

Same layout as `examples/loopback` and `examples/dhcp_dns`:

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `inc/net_config.h` | network identity, ports, timeouts, buffer size |
| `inc/web_page.h` | the page served as `/` and `/index.html` |
| `inc/http_server.h` | engine API |
| `src/http_server.c` | backend-neutral HTTP/1.1 server (BSD sockets via a vtable) |
| `main/main.c` | orchestration only: bring interfaces up, start the tasks |

Compared with the ioLibrary version this was ported from:

- `httpServer_run()`'s `Sn_SR` state machine (`SOCK_ESTABLISHED` / `SOCK_CLOSE_WAIT` / `SOCK_CLOSED` plus the manual re-listen) over a fixed list of hardware sockets collapses into a plain `accept()` loop;
- `httpServer_time_handler()` and its 1-second `esp_timer` disappear — the session timeout is just `SO_RCVTIMEO` on the socket;
- the `httpParser` / `httpUtil` content registry disappears too, since this example serves exactly one page.

## Step 4: Build

After completing the setup, build the project.

```bash
idf.py build
```

![][link-build_log]

## Step 5: Upload and Run

Flash the firmware and open the serial monitor. Replace the port with your board's serial port.

```bash
idf.py -p COMx flash monitor
```

On Linux/macOS:

```bash
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```

When the device boots, the assigned IP and the listening log appear in the terminal.

```
I (522) wiztoe_net: TOE up: 192.168.11.2 (WIZnet hardware TCP/IP)
I (525) http: [eth] waiting for link...
I (527) http: [eth] HTTP server listening on port 80
```

With Wi-Fi configured, the second server appears once DHCP has assigned an address:

```
I (xxxxx) wifi: got IP 192.168.11.7
I (xxxxx) http: [wifi] HTTP server listening on port 8080
```

![][link-run_socket_open]

Open a web browser and enter the device URL `http://192.168.11.2/` in the address bar (or `http://192.168.11.7:8080/` for the Wi-Fi server).
![][link-run_browser]

The served web page appears, showing the **Hello, World!** heading from `web_page.h`, and each request is logged:

```
I (xxxxx) http: [eth] GET /
I (xxxxx) http: [eth] GET /favicon.ico
```

![][link-run_webpage]

## Appendix

- **One connection at a time:** Each interface runs a single listener and serves connections sequentially, closing after every response (`Connection: close`). This matches the WIZnet hardware sockets, where `accept()` returns the *same* socket it listened on and `close()` re-arms it — a second connection cannot be accepted while the first is open. The ioLibrary version spread `httpServer_run()` across 4 hardware sockets instead; running several listeners on one port is not portable to the software LwIP backend, where `bind()` would clash.
- **Requests handled:** `GET` and `HEAD` for `/` and `/index.html` (a query string is ignored). Anything else gets `404 Not Found`; other methods get `501 Not Implemented`. Requests whose headers exceed `HTTP_BUF_SIZE` are truncated.
- **Session timeout:** `SO_RCVTIMEO` (`HTTP_RECV_TIMEOUT_MS`) bounds both `accept()` and `recv()`, so a task that never sees a client — or a client that connects and then goes silent — keeps looping instead of wedging.
- **1 ms tick:** `sdkconfig.defaults` sets `CONFIG_FREERTOS_HZ=1000`. The TOE poll loops (`wiztoe_accept` / `wiztoe_recv`) yield in 1 ms steps and count those steps for `SO_RCVTIMEO`; at the IDF default of 100 Hz a 1 ms delay truncates to 0 ticks, which busy-waits and starves the idle task.
- **W6300 QSPI mode:** Quad mode (4-bit) requires the extra D2/D3 lines wired and selected in `Component config -> WIZnet WSM Driver -> W6300 QSPI mode`. Single mode uses the same 4-wire wiring as W5500.
