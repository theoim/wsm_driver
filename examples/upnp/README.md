# How to Test UPnP Example

> **Verified on both chips.** This example was run on a W6300 (QSPI) and on a W5500 (standard SPI, XIAO ESP32-S3), over Ethernet and Wi-Fi in each case.

## Step 1: Prepare software

The following serial terminal program and UPnP-enabled router are required for the UPnP example test, download and install from below links.

- [Tera Term][link-tera_term]

A UPnP-enabled router (Internet Gateway Device, IGD) on the same LAN is also required. No PC test utility is needed beyond the serial terminal; the example is driven entirely from the serial menu, and the result is confirmed in Tera Term and (optionally) on the router's UPnP / port-forwarding page.

## Step 2: Prepare hardware

1. Connect the WIZnet Ethernet chip (W5500 or W6300) to the ESP32-S3 board over SPI, following the pin table in [Step 3](#step-3-setup-upnp-example).
2. Connect an Ethernet cable from the module's RJ45 port to your UPnP-enabled router (the same LAN the router serves).
3. Connect the ESP32-S3 board to your PC with a USB cable.

## Step 3: Setup UPnP Example

### Chip and SPI configuration

Set the target and open menuconfig:

```bash
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py menuconfig
```

Select **Component config**.
![][link-config_main]

Select **WIZnet WSM Driver** under Component config.
![][link-config_component]

Choose the WIZnet chip, and check the per-socket buffer size. SPI host, clock, and pins follow the selected chip automatically. In this example, SPI2 of the ESP32-S3 is used at 33 MHz.
![][link-config_wiz_toe]

> This example ships with **W6300** selected by default (`sdkconfig.defaults`). Switch to W5500 under `Component config -> WIZnet WSM Driver -> WIZnet chip` if needed.

**W5500 wiring (standard SPI)**

| W5500 | ESP32-S3 Pin |
|-------|--------------|
| MISO  | 13 |
| MOSI  | 11 |
| SCLK  | 12 |
| CS    | 10 |
| RESET | 9  |
| INT   | 14 |

**W6300 wiring (QSPI)**

| W6300   | ESP32-S3 Pin |
|---------|--------------|
| D0 (MOSI) | 11 |
| D1 (MISO) | 13 |
| D2 (IO2)  | 14 *(Quad mode only)* |
| D3 (IO3)  | 9  *(Quad mode only)* |
| SCLK    | 12 |
| CS      | 10 |
| RESET   | 21 |
| INT     | 8  |

### Network configuration

Configure the network settings in `examples/upnp/inc/net_config.h`. The device IP must be a valid host on the router's LAN so the IGD can map a port back to it.

```cpp
#define NET_MAC_ADDR          {0x00, 0x08, 0xDC, 0x12, 0x34, 0x56}
#define NET_IP_ADDR           {192, 168, 11, 2}
#define NET_SUBNET_MASK       {255, 255, 255, 0}
#define NET_GATEWAY           {192, 168, 11, 1}
#define NET_DNS_ADDR          {8, 8, 8, 8}

#define NET_IP_ADDR_STR       "192.168.11.2"   /* the same address as text */

#define WIFI_SSID             ""      /* empty -> Ethernet only */
#define WIFI_PASS             ""
```

`NET_IP_ADDR_STR` has to match `NET_IP_ADDR`. The eventing subscription tells the router where to send notifications, and that header is text.

### UPnP configuration

The mapping the example asks for lives in the same file.

```cpp
#define UPNP_MAP_PROTOCOL     "TCP"
#define UPNP_MAP_EXT_PORT     8000
#define UPNP_MAP_INT_IP       NET_IP_ADDR_STR
#define UPNP_MAP_INT_PORT     8000
#define UPNP_MAP_DESCRIPTION  "wsm_driver"

#define UPNP_DELETE_AFTER_ADD 1     /* 0 keeps the mapping for inspection */
#define UPNP_EVENT_LISTEN_SEC 10    /* 0 skips eventing entirely */
```

Set `UPNP_DELETE_AFTER_ADD` to 0 when you want to look at the rule in the router's admin page; at 1 each run leaves the router's table as it found it.

The client sends an SSDP M-SEARCH for `urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:InternetGatewayDevice:1` and drives the `WANIPConnection:1` service to add or delete port mappings.

### Architecture

| file | role |
| --- | --- |
| `inc/upnp_core.h` · `src/upnp_core.c` | the protocol steps and the response parsers |
| `inc/upnp_xml.h` · `src/upnp_xml.c` | builds the SSDP / HTTP / SOAP messages |
| `inc/upnp_transport.h` · `src/upnp_transport.c` | the network seam |
| `src/upnp_client.c` | runs one session: discover, describe, subscribe, map |
| `main/main.c` | orchestration only: bring the interface up, start the session |

The protocol implementation is ioLibrary's, carried in the example rather than used from `third_party`, so its network calls could be swapped for BSD ones without forking the submodule. It reaches the network exclusively through `upnp_transport.h`, whose implementation calls the component's `net_sock_ops_t` vtable — so the same code runs on the W6300's hardware sockets or on the software LwIP behind the Wi-Fi netif.

The seam is coarser than one function per socket call. Each step in the original opened a socket by number, spun on `getSn_SR()` until the chip reported `SOCK_INIT`, connected, spun again for `SOCK_ESTABLISHED`, transferred, polled the receive register, and closed. Those states have no BSD equivalent, so the seam takes a whole exchange — `upnp_transport_http()` sends one request and returns the response — and the chip-specific choreography disappears rather than being emulated.

### Running on Wi-Fi instead (optional)

Fill in `WIFI_SSID` / `WIFI_PASS` and set `UPNP_OVER_WIFI` to 1. Like the tftp example this runs one interface at a time: `upnp_core.c` keeps the discovered IGD in globals, so two concurrent sessions would share it.

On Wi-Fi the callback address advertised to the router is read off the netif after DHCP rather than taken from `NET_IP_ADDR_STR`, and the mapping follows it — that is what the empty `UPNP_MAP_INT_IP` is for. Pinning it to the Ethernet address would open the port onto an interface the session is not using.

```
I (82843) wifi: got IP 192.168.11.7
I (82905) upnp: [wifi] sending M-SEARCH (1/5)
I (82910) upnp_tx: SSDP reply from 192.168.11.1 (404 bytes)
I (82911) upnp: [wifi] IGD found at 192.168.11.1:64690
I (82952) upnp: [wifi] subscribed to eventing
I (82955) upnp: [wifi] waiting 10s for eventing on port 5002
I (93018) upnp: [wifi] mapped TCP 8002 -> 192.168.11.7:8000 ("wsm_driver")
```

The router lists it against the Wi-Fi lease, not the static Ethernet address:

```
UPnP 규칙               프로토콜   외부 포트   내부 IP          내부 포트
002 wsm_driver_tcp_8001   TCP        8001     192.168.11.7      8000
```

Two differences from the Ethernet run are worth expecting. The first M-SEARCH succeeds — the `errno 5` below is a W6300 behaviour and Wi-Fi goes through LwIP instead. And the DHCP lease can take anywhere from two seconds to three minutes to arrive; five runs on the same AP measured 2.5 s, 29 s, 82 s, 86 s and 181 s. Ethernet is never affected. It is Wi-Fi power save meeting an access point that buffers broadcasts poorly — `esp_wifi_set_ps(WIFI_PS_NONE)` after `wifi_net_init()` brought all five boots to about 2.2 s. `examples/udp_multicast` has the measurements and why the workaround is not applied by default.

### Differences from the original example

- **The serial menu is gone.** `hyperterminal.c` waited on keystrokes to pick each action, which cannot be exercised without someone at the keyboard. The sequence it drove — discover, describe, subscribe, add, delete — now runs on its own from `net_config.h`. The LED, network-setting and loopback menu entries went with it; loopback has its own example.
- **Requests ask the router to close.** The original sent `Connection: Keep-Alive`, which cost it nothing: it polled the chip's receive register and never waited on the peer. A BSD read loop has to know where the response ends, and a router honouring keep-alive holds the connection open, so every exchange ran to the receive timeout — and one that answered a little slowly was reported as failed *after the router had already applied it*. `Connection: close` ends the read with the response; the measured gap between the request and the log line went from over four seconds to 63 ms.
- **Eventing notifications are always acknowledged.** The callback handler only replied `200 OK` when it had managed to read a body. An unacknowledged NOTIFY is retried, and at least one router stops serving control actions while it retries — which surfaced as `AddPortMapping` timing out seconds later. The reply is now unconditional.
- **A timeout is not reported as a failure.** If no answer arrives, the request still reached the router and may have been applied, so the log says that rather than claiming the action failed.
- **Timeouts work.** Every receive loop was written as `endTime = my_time + 3; while (recv(...) <= 0 && my_time < endTime);`, where `my_time` is only advanced by `data_process_count_handle()` — which nothing calls, here or upstream. `my_time` stays 0, the guard never trips, and a router that does not answer hangs the loop forever instead of timing out after three seconds. The same dead counter is in the ioLibrary TFTP client, so it is worth reporting upstream.
- **Message building no longer touches the chip.** `MakeSubscribe()` called `getSIPR()` to read the local address out of the WIZnet registers. It is a parameter now, and `upnp_xml.c` has no hardware dependency.
- **Parsed fields are bounded.** The parsers copied element bodies into fixed buffers using lengths taken from the document, so a long enough reply ran past the end of them. Everything here arrives from the router, so the lengths are checked.
- **The byte-order and address helpers are gone.** `UPnP.c` carried its own `inet_addr`, `inet_ntoa`, `htons`, `htonl`, `ntohs`, `ntohl` and friends, whose signatures clash with lwIP's. Because the seam takes addresses as strings, nothing referenced them any more.

## Step 4: Build

After completing the setup, build the project.

```bash
idf.py build
```

![][link-build_log]

## Step 5: Upload and Run

Flash the firmware and open the serial monitor. Replace the port with your board's serial port.

```bash
idf.py -p COMx flash monitor
```

On Linux/macOS:

```bash
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```

The session runs to completion on its own. A full run against an ipTIME router, with `UPNP_DELETE_AFTER_ADD` set to 0 so the mapping survives:

```
I (437)   wiztoe_net: TOE up: 192.168.11.2 (WIZnet hardware TCP/IP)
I (437)   upnp: [eth] sending M-SEARCH (1/5)
E (2050)  upnp_tx: M-SEARCH to 239.255.255.250:1900 failed: errno 5
I (2051)  upnp: [eth] sending M-SEARCH (2/5)
I (2056)  upnp_tx: SSDP reply from 192.168.11.1 (404 bytes)
I (2058)  upnp: [eth] IGD found at 192.168.11.1:64690
I (2071)  upnp: [eth] controlURL   /ctl/IPConn
I (2071)  upnp: [eth] eventSubURL  /evt/IPConn
I (2078)  upnp: [eth] subscribed to eventing
I (2079)  upnp: [eth] waiting 10s for eventing on port 5002
I (12107) upnp: [eth] mapped TCP 8000 -> 192.168.11.2:8000 ("wsm_driver")
I (12107) upnp: [eth] mapping left in place — check the router's admin page
I (12109) upnp: [eth] session finished
```

The failed first M-SEARCH is expected — see [`M-SEARCH ... failed: errno 5`](#m-search--failed-errno-5). `sending M-SEARCH` repeats up to five times, so a lost or dropped first datagram costs a few milliseconds rather than the run.

Nothing printed between `waiting 10s` and the mapping: this router accepts the SUBSCRIBE and then never calls back. That is common and does not affect port mapping.

![][link-run_discovery]

### Confirm the mapping

Set `UPNP_DELETE_AFTER_ADD` to 0 and rebuild, then open your router's admin page and look at the **UPnP** or **Port Forwarding** list. On an ipTIME router that is *NAT/라우터 관리 -> 포트포워드 설정*, where UPnP-created rules are listed under **UPnP 규칙**, separately from the manually entered **사용자 규칙**:

```
UPnP 규칙 (1)          프로토콜   외부 포트   내부 IP          내부 포트
001 wsm_driver_tcp_8000   TCP        8000     192.168.11.2      8000
```

The router derived that name from `UPNP_MAP_DESCRIPTION` by appending the protocol and port; some routers show the description verbatim instead.

![][link-run_router]

## Troubleshooting

### `no IGD answered`

```
E (xxx) upnp: [eth] no IGD answered — is UPnP enabled on the router?
```

The five M-SEARCH probes all went unanswered. In order of likelihood:

- **UPnP is off on the router.** Most consumer routers ship with it enabled, but many ISP-supplied ones do not. Look for "UPnP" or "UPnP IGD" in the admin page and turn it on.
- **The device IP is not on the router's LAN.** `NET_IP_ADDR` has to be a free host address in the router's subnet, and `NET_GATEWAY` has to be the router.
- **The router is not an IGD.** A switch or an access point in bridge mode has nothing to map; the search has to reach the device that owns the WAN connection.

If all five attempts fail with `errno 5` rather than simply going unanswered, read the next entry.

### `M-SEARCH ... failed: errno 5`

```
E (2050) upnp_tx: M-SEARCH to 239.255.255.250:1900 failed: errno 5
```

Expected on the first attempt of a run against a **W6300**, and harmless: the retry immediately after it succeeds. A W5500 does not show it at all — its first M-SEARCH goes out and the router answers within milliseconds.

`sendto()` to `239.255.255.250` needs a destination MAC, and ioLibrary's `sendto()` has no multicast handling — it hands the address to the chip, which tries to resolve it by ARP and gives up after about 1.6 s (that is the gap between the two log lines above). By the second attempt the send goes out and the router answers within milliseconds.

`DISCOVER_ATTEMPTS` in `src/upnp_client.c` exists for this. If a chip or firmware makes every attempt fail this way, the fix belongs in `upnp_transport_ssdp()` — it would set the group before opening the socket, the way `examples/udp_multicast` does — and `upnp_core.c` would not change.

### `AddPortMapping failed (718)`

A positive value is the router's own UPnP error code, returned verbatim:

| code | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 402 | invalid arguments |
| 501 | action failed |
| 715 | the router only accepts a wildcard remote host |
| 718 | that external port is already mapped to a different host |
| 725 | the router only accepts permanent leases |

718 usually means a previous run left its mapping behind — the lease duration this example asks for is 0, meaning permanent, so the router keeps it until something removes it.

The most common way to hit it is to run once on Ethernet with `UPNP_DELETE_AFTER_ADD` at 0 and then switch to Wi-Fi: the external port is still held for the Ethernet address, and the Wi-Fi run asks for the same port against its DHCP lease. Clearing it:

- Run once on the interface that owns the mapping, with `UPNP_DELETE_AFTER_ADD` at 1. Same internal address means no conflict on the add, and the delete at the end removes the entry. Doing this from the *other* interface does not work — the router will not let one host delete another's mapping.
- Or delete the rule in the router's admin page.

`upnp_delete_port()` on its own would also do it, but the example does not expose a delete-only mode.

### `subscribe failed`

Eventing is optional and the run continues without it. Some routers accept the SUBSCRIBE and then never call back, and some reject it outright — neither prevents port mapping. Set `UPNP_EVENT_LISTEN_SEC` to 0 to skip the step.

## Appendix

- **Echo-testing the mapped port:** the original's menu could start a TCP or UDP loopback on the port it had just mapped. That belongs to `examples/loopback`, which does the same thing on both interfaces — run it after this example with `UPNP_DELETE_AFTER_ADD` set to 0.
- **W6300 QSPI mode:** Quad mode (4-bit) requires the extra D2/D3 lines wired and selected in `Component config -> WIZnet WSM Driver -> W6300 QSPI mode`. Single mode uses the same 4-wire wiring as W5500.
