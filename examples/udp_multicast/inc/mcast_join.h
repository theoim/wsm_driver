 * Multicast group membership, split out of the receive engine.
 *
 * Joining is the one step in this example that cannot be written once for both
 * backends, because the two disagree about when the group has to be known:
 *
 *   - LwIP joins an already-bound socket. setsockopt(IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP) is all
 *     it takes, and the IGMP report goes out from software.
 *   - The W6300 derives the group's multicast MAC for Sn_DHAR from Sn_DIPR at
 *     the moment the socket is opened, so the group must be in the registers
 *     BEFORE the open -- after bind() has already opened it. The only way to
 *     apply a join at that point is to close the hardware socket and reopen it
 *     with Sn_MR_MULTI set.
 *
 * Everything else -- socket, bind, recvfrom -- is plain BSD through the vtable
 * on both paths. Only this one call is backend-specific, which is why it is a
 * function pointer rather than an #if inside mcast_rx.c.
 *
 * Deliberately no component headers here: mcast_join_toe.c includes ioLibrary's
 * socket.h and mcast_join_bsd.c includes lwIP's, and those two must never meet
 * in one translation unit. `ops` is a const void * for the same reason.
