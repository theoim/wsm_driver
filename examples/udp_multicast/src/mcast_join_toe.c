 * Multicast join for the WIZnet hardware sockets (see mcast_join.h).
 *
 * The chip derives the group's multicast MAC for Sn_DHAR from Sn_DIPR when the
 * socket is opened, so a group cannot be added to a socket that is already
 * running. bind() has opened it by the time a BSD join arrives, so the join
 * closes the hardware socket and reopens it with the group programmed and
 * Sn_MR_MULTI set. Datagrams arriving during the reopen are lost, which is
 * acceptable: a join happens once at start-up, before any traffic is expected.
 *
 * This is the one place in the example that steps outside the socket API. It
 * needs the chip's socket number, and what it is handed is a BSD fd, so it
 * relies on the mapping the component's --wrap layer applies:
 *
 *     fd == hardware socket number + LWIP_SOCKET_OFFSET
 *
 * That is an internal rule of wsm_driver, not a published contract. If it ever
 * changes this file keeps compiling and starts poking the wrong socket, so the
 * mapping is checked at runtime before anything is written -- see below.
 *
 * Two things this file must not do. It must not include any lwIP header --
 * ioLibrary's socket.h declares close() as int8_t(uint8_t) against POSIX's
 * int(int), and lwIP drags the POSIX one in, so the two cannot be seen
 * together. That is why the socket offset arrives through a function
 * (mcast_lwip_socket_offset()) instead of the macro. And it must not be used
 * when the wrap is off -- see the guard below.
