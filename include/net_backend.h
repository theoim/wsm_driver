/* Isolation layer: wizchip_conf.h -> W5500/w5500.h:920,925 defines SOCK_STREAM
 * and SOCK_DGRAM as ioLibrary's Sn_MR protocol values (0x01 / 0x02), while
 * lwip/sockets.h:197,198 defines the same names as POSIX socket types (1 / 2).
 * Neither header guards its definition, so any TU that sees both gets a
 * -Werror redefinition error (the numeric values happen to match; the conflict
 * is purely at the preprocessor level).
 *
 * This component's public API is meant to be used alongside lwIP BSD sockets,
 * so the ioLibrary aliases are dropped here and the lwIP definitions are left
 * to win. Nothing in this project needs the aliases: code that talks to the
 * hardware sockets spells the protocol out as Sn_MR_TCP / Sn_MR_UDP (see
 * port/ioLibrary_Driver/src/wiznet_toe.c). W6300/w6300.h does not define them
 * at all, which is why only the W5500 build ever hit this.
 *
 * ORDERING: include this header (or any other ioLibrary header) BEFORE
 * lwip/sockets.h. In the reverse order w5500.h redefines lwIP's macros before
 * this point is reached and the error comes back. */
