 * Ethernet (W5500) socket vtable: the plain lwIP BSD entry points. With
 * WSM_DRIVER_SOCKET_WRAP=1 these lwip_* symbols are --wrap-redirected to the
 * W5500 hardware sockets; with =0 they are software LwIP over esp_eth. Naming
 * lwip_* is correct in BOTH cases, so this file needs no #if — writing
 * __wrap_lwip_* explicitly would instead fail to link when the wrap is off.
